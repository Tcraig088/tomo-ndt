    "# Usage \n",
    "\n",
    "The Tomo NDt Library is a library that works on top of [Tomo Base](https://github.com/Tcraig088/tomobase). The purpose of this library is to extrapolate functions from 2D 3D to consider time dependent effects. In addition it allows storage of volume-time data in a compressed file allowin for convient storage of metadata and compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read Write \n",
    "\n",
    "Volume Time series data is read and written to disk and only accessed where required. To initialize an ndt data set provide a location to save data to and a volume to initialize its shape, pixelsize and metadata. Volume data can be written or read from a volume time series using the read and write_volume functions while specifying the time in seconds. "

    "## Operators \n",
    "The libary abstracts tomography tasks into operations. These operations each transform one data type into another. A reconstruction is a tomographic procedure which transforms a 2D into a 3D sinogram. When working with time dependent data some operations that would typically transform data into 3D need to operate with 3D + the time dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example is segmentation. A typical post processing of segmentation procedure will deform a 3D volume to create another 3D volume or labelled dataset. When conducted with time, this procedure must be performed on all volumes in a volume time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Tomo NDt library supports the following conversions on top of procedures already available by Tomo Base:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deformation: Converts a volume into a volume time series by iteratively applying a deformation to a volume\n",
    "2. Forward Projection: Converts a volume-time series to a temporally labelled Sinogram\n",
    "3. Reconstruct: Converts a Sinogram into a volume time series\n",
    "4. Segmentation/Post processing: Converts a volume time series into a volume time series."
